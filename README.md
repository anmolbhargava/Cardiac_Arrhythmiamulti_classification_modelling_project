# Cardiac-Arrhythmia-Multi-Classification-ML-Project

- Aim: Distinguish presence/absence of cardiac arrhythmia and to classify it into one of the 16 groups

- Result: Performed various classification techniques such as KNN, logistic, linear & kernelized SVM, Decision tree, Random forest, PCA               algorithms, advanced ensemble and Boosting techniques achieving an accuracy of 92.98%

The contents of this repository are:

  - cardiac_arrhythmia.csv: data for this problem
  - Metadata.docx: a data dictionary detailing all variables for the problem and their characteristics/definition
  - Cardiac_Arrhythmia_Multi_Classification.ipynb: a detailed jupyter notebook with data cleaning and analysis, models and results
